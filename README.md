# Christmas Calendar

This is a fun project that I did during at the 2018 Southern Utah Code Camp
to be able to start playing with the new Ionic 4 that was in beta at the
time. 

you can check it out at [ChristmasCalendar.org](https://christmascalendar.org)!

Note: this project was done in Ionic 4 Beta 15.  There may be breaking changes 
in the code from the current version of Ionic 4.
